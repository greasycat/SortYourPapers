"""A ceiling on what the tool may spend at the API, and a record of what it has.

The watcher is installed as a launchd agent with `KeepAlive`, which means the
one thing that reliably restarts it is failure. A pass that dies partway through
comes back, re-reads the same folder, and pays for the same documents again —
and nothing anywhere else in the pipeline counts, so that loop runs until
somebody notices it on a bill.

So every model request passes through a ledger first. It records requests and
tokens in hourly buckets, keeps a rolling day of them, and refuses a request
that would start beyond the ceiling. Refusing *before* the call is the point:
a limit checked afterwards has already been paid.

The ledger is machine-wide rather than per-library, because the cost is
machine-wide: two libraries on one API key spend the same money. It is shared
between processes, so writes take a lock and land whole — a counter that loses
increments under contention would drift the wrong way, undercounting exactly
when the most is being spent.
